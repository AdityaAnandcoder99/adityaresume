            <p> A small application to resolve the search for a coin by the players for a Toss.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>I am very fond of sports. Cricket is one of the games I like to play and I feel confident playing it.</li>
                <li> I noticed everytime players (Gully Cricket) , search for a coin or something colorful that can flip, as in this digital era we somehow are not fond of keeping change.</li>
                <li>It is when I thought of developing a website for solving their problem of the Toss. I used Python and it web development tool to create an application that solves this daily problem of our emerging players. </li>
